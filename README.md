# HelloWord
Hello World Coding Exercise

Simple console application that writes "Hello World" to the console window if app.config setting for "isCodingExercise" value is set to true, else "Foo" is displayed.

The solution structure was created to be able to use the same code bases throughout multiple projects with separated data-access, business logic, and utility layers. A "HelloWorld.Models" project is not included in this solution, but would be if there was a need to pull data from a data source and represent the data with viewmodels.
